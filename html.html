Project 1, Negotiated report 
<p>Introduction:
For our negotiated project we created a modern Minecraft city, I started playing Minecraft in 2013 (grade 4) and got back into it a few years ago. I never made extreme builds just played on servers so creating a world like this is new to me. I have played on the PS4 version of Minecraft on numerous occasions but I don’t enjoy it as much as I do the PC version and the same goes for the PE edition (Pocket edition on phones and iPad). I find the other versions a lot harder to use because I started playing on the PC edition, which is why we decided to use the PC edition. </p>

<p1>Objectives
Our objective for this negotiated project was to plan and build a realistic Minecraft city, we really wanted our city to include skyscrapers, a park, shops and a housing area. We would like to have a main city centre and strips of stores as well. We would like the stores to be real stores that we have.

To simplify
•	To plan and create a city
•	Make the city as realistic as possible
•	Add in places that we like and where we would like to live.
We really wanted our city to include skyscrapers, a park, shops and a housing area.
Results
We managed to achieve a city centre and shopping area we also made a housing strip and lake area. </p1>
   
<p2>Process and planning:
We planned the style of our buildings and our houses by googling images of cities and houses that we liked, took screenshots of them and used them as references for our own builds. We started off with basic maps for roads and built the main road to base where we wanted the centre to be. We placed some of the major “skyscrapers” first and built around them, we build stores and cafes around the big buildings. Around the centre block we built stores and apartments, these stores included McDonalds, Subway, Nike and a BMW dealership just to name a few. 
We put in a lake surrounded by a housing strip and a few larger buildings i.e. a hospital and a church.</p2>

<p3>Discussion:
We are happy with what we were able to achieve in the time given but we would like to have gotten more done, we were focusing at the start on quantity over quality which we soon realised wasn’t a very good idea and looked more in detail at the buildings that we had built rather than building more immediately. By doing so and taking a step back we could see what looked wrong and what needed more detail.
There are a lot of gaps in our project but in our main focus area (the city centre) we have filled it in, making little seating areas and placing stone brick to fill in gaps between buildings.
We started off our builds in a very modern theme but by the end we realised that’s not realistic and there would be older looking buildings still around, we then had a pretty even amount of each.
If we were to redo this project I would have chosen to play on Minecraft EDU so we have more buildings tools to use, I would have also planned out exactly where our buildings would go and plan out where you would put things In relation to other things that makes sense.
To get ideas for our buildings we went onto google and YouTube to find tutorials and just reference photos </p3>
